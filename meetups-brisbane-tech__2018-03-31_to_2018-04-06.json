This is the book I had to write and is my story, one I know many people going through the same things will find solace and comfort in because business and divorce can be extremely frightening and lonely. It is the self-help book I couldn't find when it comes to being in business and going through one of the most traumatic times of my life (divorce is one of the 5 most stressful things you can go through in your lifetime).</p> <p>Throughout the book are my diary entries and the methods I used to not only survive my first and second year of business but smash it and while also working on myself to come out the other end relatively unscathed.</p> <p>My life changed in ways I could never imagine and in one way, shape or form, you have helped mould it.</p> <p>I would love to invite you to my book launch happening on April 5 in Brisbane (destination TBC).</p> <p>The theme of the night is leading an amazing life and having meaningful relationships in all areas of life!</p> <p>Tickets are $20 and include a drink on arrival, food, guest speaker and networking opportunities - and a magical surprise!

            "simple_html_description": "The Divorce Diary: A Modern Business Woman's Survival Guilde for Separation and Divorce.\n\n\nLife is funny what it can throw at you and even funnier with its timing.\n\n\nAbout 4 years ago I started on a transformational journey I didn't know I was about to take, but I knew it needed to take it.\n\n\nIt started with my new business and then a divorce, and was the perfect recipe for a life disaster ... a startup emotional woman who had just left her husband. This is the book I had to write and is my story, one I know many people going through the same things will find solace and comfort in because business and divorce can be extremely frightening and lonely. It is the self-help book I couldn't find when it comes to being in business and going through one of the most traumatic times of my life (divorce is one of the 5 most stressful things you can go through in your lifetime).\n\n\nThroughout the book are my diary entries and the methods I used to not only survive my first and second year of business but smash it and while also working on myself to come out the other end relatively unscathed.\n\n\nMy life changed in ways I could never imagine and in one way, shape or form, you have helped mould it.\n\n\nI would love to invite you to my book launch happening on April 5 in Brisbane (destination TBC).\n\n\nThe theme of the night is leading an amazing life and having meaningful relationships in all areas of life!\n\n\nTickets are $20 and include a drink on arrival, food, guest speaker and networking opportunities - and a magical surprise! Signed books will be available on the night.\n\n\nCome and join us! Tickets at: https://www.stickytickets.com.au/64177\n\n\nSee you there!\n\n\nLiz"
